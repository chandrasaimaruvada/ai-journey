# Day 2 â€” Python Basics (Variables & Data Types)
**Date:** 2025-08-18

## âœ… What I did today
- Reviewed Python syntax and indentation
- Practiced variables (strings, integers, floats, booleans)
- Explored basic data types (list, dict, tuple, set)
- Wrote first practice script `day2_basics.py`
- Learned about `print()` formatting and type conversion

## ðŸ“Œ How I felt
ðŸ˜€ Confident and curious â€” starting to actually *code*, not just setup.

## ðŸ”œ Next Step (Day 3)
- Practice writing functions
- Add simple unit tests with `pytest`
- Build a small calculator CLI
